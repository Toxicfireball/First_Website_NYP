      <p id="na">Warhammer Fantsay battle is not a really a story, but instead a setting. While many of its ideas aren't particularly original, when all of it mesh it does create a unique setting. It's set on a single planet in which multiple races live. While many of these are your usual standard fantasy races like Orcs,Dwarfs and Elves,it does feature several uniques races. The Warhammer Fantasy setting was original developed as a setting for the tabletop game which its name came from. Over the years, the setting gained books that enriched its universe as well as games. While the settings had a rough period in which it was seemingly left to rot, in recent time the settings have been reviltalised and injected with new life.</p>

      <p id="nn">Warhammer Fantasy is set on a planet extremely similar to earth. It's filled with multiple races, the most predominant being Men,Dwarfs,Orcs,Elfs,Lizardmen and Skaven. The Skaven are the most uniques race in WFB, they are a race of literal man-sized rat men, they are evil in every sense and are the most numerous. They are highly intelligent and cunning, capable of mutating  creatures to become horrific monsters or creating weapons such as flamethrowers,nuclear bombs and machine guns that are far superior(and more unreliable) than any of the other races weapons. The main threat in Warhammer are chaos,which are made up of four gods that continously attempt to send their armies of demons and mortals to conqueror the other races. They have been held back due to a magical vortex created by the High Elves helped by the Lizardmen. The setting of Warhammer Fantasy is one of fleeting glory and endless war, where the common men stand united against the terrors of Orks,Vampire and Demons.</p>

        <p id="nk">Age of Sigmar is supposed to be a contuation of Warhammer Fantasy. In 2015, Age of Sigmar was created after Warhammer Fantasy was discontinued. While initially met with extremely hostile backlash, Age of Sigmar has grown to become an increasing popular universe. While it has many of the same factions as Warhammer Fantasy, it has a completely different setting, taking place across eight magical realms. It is the sequel tp Warhammer Fantasy but it does not mean Warhammer Fantasy is dead. Warhammer Fantasy is still getting new media such as games and books! Age of Sigmar also has different themes compared to Warhammer Fantasy. While both are "High" Fantasy, Age of Sigmar is significantly more "high" as the gods take a far more active role than in Warhammer Fantasy.</p>

<p> Warhammer Fantasy has largely been revived thanks to the Total War: Warhammer Franchise which has popularised this universe. Here are some of the game trailers which show of the Warhammer Fantasy universe!</p>
