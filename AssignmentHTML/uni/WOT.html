          <h2>What is the Wheel of Time</h2>
        <p id="na">The Wheel of Time is a series of high fantasy novels written by American author James Oliver Rigney Jr., under his pen name of Robert Jordan. Originally planned as a six-book series, The Wheel of Time spanned fourteen volumes, in addition to a prequel novel and two companion books. Jordan began writing the first volume, The Eye of the World, in 1984, and it was published in January 1990.</p>

      <p id="nn">Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time is a story that takes place both in our past and our future. In his fantasy world, the Dark One, the embodiment of pure evil, is breaking free from his prison. The overall plot is about a man who learns that he is the reincarnation of the world’s messiah and is once again destined to save the world from the Dark One — but possibly destroy it in the process. This saga is not only his story, but the story of an entire world’s struggle to deal with war and change, destruction and hope.</p>

        <p id="nk">It has a beautiful emotional intelligence that makes the character arcs and the relationships especially potent.It was very forward thinking about the importance of understanding and uniting disparate cultures in a very real-world applicable way.It is also deeply focused gender roles in an expansive way crossing over with the cultural perspective above. The core concept of male power being tainted by a historical rift with female power and requiring the genders to come back into balance is particularly powerful. The metaphors for what's it's like to access male and female power. It's all just incredibly thoughtful and useful imagery.The depth of the world building that goes into making the different cultures what they are and how they interact is incredible.</p>
